# PyBank Challenge:

# Create a Python script that analyzes the records (budget_data.csv) to calculate
# each of the following values:
    # The total number of months included in the dataset
    # The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    # The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the 
    # average of those changes
    # The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    # The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
# Your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a 
# text file with the results

import csv
